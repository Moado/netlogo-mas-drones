netlogo-mas-drones
==================

A NetLogo 5 multi-agents system simulating a civil drones mission, where they have to escort and protect a humanitarian convoy transporting a critical cargo.

The flying drones are totally autonomous, they can follow the convoy, look ahead of it, explore surroundings and detect potential threats and communicate their positions to the convoy to trace a new safer route. They are communicating wirelessly in a decentralized fashion by using three different techniques to ensure the reliability of communication and that their information is totally up-to-date with the latest findings from any of the other drones.

This simulation was done by Stephen Larroque, Olivier Hotel and Issam Bani as part of a university project at the University Pierre-and-Marie-Curie (Paris VI) in artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems.
